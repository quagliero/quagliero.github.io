The best piece of web development advice I ever received wasn&lsquo;t at a conference, or found in the latest Smashing Book offering, it came from a former colleague, <a href="https://twitter.com/fitzpas">@fitzpas</a>, when he told me &ldquo;People just need to know it&rsquo;s okay to be shit.&rdquo;

Not properly shit, but shit when compared to the continuous stream of magnificence that is regurgitated down our Twitter feeds.

It&rsquo;s as if there&rsquo;s an inherent inferioty complex in the industry and we just look to the same <strike>people</strike> deities to give us validation.

## Want to be less shit?

Then be shit.

Keep being shit.

But don&rsquo;t wallow in being shit, embrace it, put your shit online.

Built a Sass mixin that helps you out a lot? Awesome.

Written some JavaScript that got you out of a pickle? Even better.

Finally made sense of HTML5 &lt;article&gt; and &lt;section&gt; tags? Incredible.

Share your shit. Let other like-minded shitters improve your shit. And you theirs.

## Shitting back

I can&rsquo;t count the amount of times I must&rsquo;ve stumbled into an issue during builds only to be saved because another shit developer posted their shit online.

We&rsquo;re constantly building, iterating, enhancing, fixing, debugging and committing. Why not take a little extra time and put some of that shit out there so others can use it, share it, discuss it, or even just shit on it?

I know I haven&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s an open web which I have used and not given back to.

### So what&rsquo;s next for me?

*Building this site.*

As Web Developers we use a whole host of different tools and tech, and I intend to share my processes, choices, and shit, in the development of this here site.

And then I&rsquo;ll fill it with more shit.

Good <strong>and</strong> bad. Because that&rsquo;s how we get not... shit.
